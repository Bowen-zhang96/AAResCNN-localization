This is the official code for 'CSI-Fingerprinting Indoor Localization via Attention-Augmented Residual Convolutional Neural Network' [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10018917)

## Dataset
I downloaded the dataset from the home page of the author of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11523.pdf), which is now unavailable. For this version, it is available in [my google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MoGZib9pC1Pe9wigXwtPLeRyNJQ3Dihr/view?usp=sharing), in case of the data format of different versions is different.

However, I have no right to distribute this dataset. Please follow the instructions of KU leuven lab for the use of this dataset. 

## Architecture
The paper consists of three parts, positioning, tracking, and IMU-aided tracking. I will gradually update the code for each part.

## Acknowledge 
The code is developped based on [this project](https://github.com/sibrendebast/MaMIMO-CSI-positioning-using-CNNs)
